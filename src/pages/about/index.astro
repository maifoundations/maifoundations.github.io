  <p>
    Multimodal AI Foundations is a long-term research initiative dedicated to advancing the
    field of multimodal artificial intelligence. Our work focuses on developing foundational
    machine learning methods and systems that integrate vision, language, and other modalities,
    with a strong emphasis on robustness, efficiency, and safety. By pushing the boundaries of
    how AI models perceive, reason, and interact across diverse data types, we aim to build
    generalizable and trustworthy AI systems that can operate reliably in complex real-world
    environments.

    This initiative is led by
    Prof. <a href='https://kaiyangzhou.github.io/' target='_blank'>Kaiyang Zhou</a>
    and his <a href='https://kaiyangzhou.github.io/team.html' target='_blank'>team</a>
